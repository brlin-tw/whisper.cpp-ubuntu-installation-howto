## Acquire the projects release package

To assist on the tutorial, download the project's release package from the
Releases page and extract it.  Then, launch your preferred terminal application
and run the following command to switch the working directory to the extracted
project working directory.

```bash
cd /path/to/whisper.cpp-ubuntu-installation-howto-X.Y.Z
```

## Installing the build dependencies

By reading [the upstream project's README](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/blob/master/README.md)
one could find out that this software requires the following build dependencies:

* GNU Make
* Build chain for building C and C++ programs

In order to install these build dependencies with uninstalling them cleanly in
mind, one can use the equivs utility to build a meta-package that depends on
these packages.

Install the equivs utility by running the following command _as root_:

```bash
apt install equivs
```

Then run the following command to build the whisper-cpp-build-deps meta-package:

```bash
equivs-build whisper-cpp-build-deps.cfl
```

After the meta-package is built you can install the meta-package by running the
following command _as root_:

```bash
apt install ./whisper-cpp-build-deps_1.0_all.deb
```
